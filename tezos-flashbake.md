# Tezos Flashbake Services


Flashbake is an open system to send transactions directly to the baker, bypassing the mempool.

MIDL.dev is one of the founding contributors of the [Flashbake Project](https://flashbake.xyz). We host a [public-access relay](https://flashbake.xyz/docs/public-relay/) to send transactions to flashbakers.

We also offer a Flashbake Endpoint Service for bakers.

## Benefits

* receive **private transactions** and increase your fee income,
* benefit from **automatic upgrades** to the last Flashbake version in the early development phase,
* your endpoint is **separate from the baker infrastructure** and protected with Cloudflare DDOS protection,
* the service is **totally free** for now.
