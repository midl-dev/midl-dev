5. <p id ="MSA5" class="xtarget">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.<a class="up" href="#MSA0"> <i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a></p>
    5.1. Pre-Existing. Each party shall retain exclusive ownership of Intellectual Property created, authored, or invented by it prior to the commencement of the Services. If Customer provides MIDLDEV OÜ with its Customer IP, Customer hereby grants to MIDLDEV OÜ, during the term of the applicable Service Order, a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, right and license (with right of sub-license where required to perform the Services) to use the Customer IP solely for the purpose of providing the Services. Customer represents and warrants that Customer has all rights in the Customer IP necessary to grant this license, and that MIDLDEV OÜ’s use of Customer IP shall not infringe on the Intellectual Property rights of any third party.

    5.2. Proprietary Rights; Deliverables. Unless otherwise specifically stated in the applicable Service Order, and excluding any Customer IP, as between the parties, MIDLDEV OÜ shall own all Intellectual Property created in providing the Services or contained in the Deliverables.

        (A) any Intellectual Property provided by MIDLDEV OÜ to Customer as part of the Services (excluding Third Party Software, Open Source Software, and Deliverables) solely for Customer’s internal use and as necessary for Customer to enjoy the benefit of the Services during the term of the applicable Service Order;
        and

6. <p id ="MSA6" class="xtarget">FEES.<a class="up" href="#MSA0"> <i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a></p>
    6.1. Fees. Customer shall pay the Fees due within 30 days from the invoice date. If Customer has arranged for payment by credit card or automated clearing house, MIDLDEV OÜ may charge Customer’s card or account on or after the invoice date. If Customer’s undisputed payment is overdue by 15 days or more, MIDLDEV OÜ may immediately suspend the associated Services and any other services Customer receives from MIDLDEV OÜ on written notice. MIDLDEV OÜ shall undertake collection efforts prior to suspension. Invoices that are not disputed within 120 days of the invoice date are conclusively deemed to be accepted as accurate by Customer. Customer shall pay the Fees in the currency identified on the Service Order, and, except as expressly permitted in section 6.3, without setoff, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding. MIDLDEV OÜ may charge interest on overdue amounts at the greater of 1.5% per month or the maximum legal rate, and may charge Customer for any cost or expense arising out of MIDLDEV OÜ’s collection efforts.

    6.2. Fee Increases.
    (A) MIDLDEV OÜ Fee Increases. Unless stated to the contrary in the Agreement and subject to sections 6.2(B) and 6.2(C), there will be no Fee increases during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. However, MIDLDEV OÜ may increase Fees following expiration of the Initial Term, any Renewal Term, or during any Auto-Renewal Term on giving at least 90 days advance written notice. For purposes of this clause, “advance written notice” means that the notice has been sent and the customer has acknowledged in writing they received it.
    (B) Holdover Rates. If Customer continues to use any Services following termination of the Agreement or applicable Service Order, Customer shall be responsible for payment of such Services at MIDLDEV OÜ’s then-current market rates.

    6.3. Taxes. All amounts due to MIDLDEV OÜ under the Agreement are exclusive of Tax. Customer shall pay MIDLDEV OÜ any Tax that is due or provide MIDLDEV OÜ with satisfactory evidence of Customer’s exemption from the Tax in advance of invoicing. Customer shall provide MIDLDEV OÜ with accurate and adequate documentation sufficient to permit MIDLDEV OÜ to determine if any Tax is due. All payments to MIDLDEV OÜ shall be made without any withholding or deduction for any taxes except for Local Withholding Taxes. Customer agrees to timely provide MIDLDEV OÜ with accurate factual information and documentation of Customer’s payment of any such Local Withholding Taxes. MIDLDEV OÜ shall remit such cost to Customer in the form of a credit on Customer’s outstanding account balance following receipt of sufficient evidence of payment of any such Local Withholding Taxes.

    6.4. Reimbursement for Expenses. Unless otherwise agreed in the Service Order, if any of the Services are performed at Customer’s premises, Customer agrees to reimburse MIDLDEV OÜ for the actual substantiated out-of-pocket expenses of its Representatives.

    6.5 MIDLDEV OÜ may use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill the customer through a payment account linked to the customer’s account for use of the Services. The processing of payments through a Payment Processor will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, MIDLDEV OÜ uses Stripe, Inc. as Payment Processor. You can access Stripe’s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. MIDLDEV OÜ is not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use the Services, you agree to pay MIDLDEV OÜ, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize MIDLDEV OÜ, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

10. <p id ="MSA10" class="xtarget">PRIVACY PRACTICES.<a class="up" href="#MSA0"> <i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a></p> Customer and MIDLDEV OÜ will comply with applicable laws in relation to their collection and processing of any Sensitive Data in the provision and use of the Services. If and to the extent the EU Directive 95/46/EC or the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (together with any transposing, implementing, or supplemental legislation “GDPR”) applies to the processing Personal Data (as defined in the GDPR) (i) MIDLDEV OÜ will process Personal Data only in accordance with Customer's instructions, except as required by applicable law, and Customer acknowledges that this Agreement, together with Customer's configuration and use of the Services, represents its complete instructions to MIDLDEV OÜ on the processing of such Personal Data. If and to the extent the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civil Code § 1798.100 et seq. (“CCPA”) applies to the processing of Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA) then the Consumer Privacy Protection Act will apply as part of this Agreement

    (A) MIDLDEV OÜ’s liability arising from: (i) death or personal injury caused by negligence; (ii) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (iii) any other loss or damages for which such limitation is expressly prohibited by applicable law, shall be unlimited.
    
    (B) Subject to section 12.1(A), the maximum aggregate monetary liability of MIDLDEV OÜ and any of its Representatives in connection with the Services or the Agreement under any theory of law shall not exceed the actual damages incurred up to the greater of: (i) an amount equal to six times the Fees payable by Customer for the Services that are the subject of the claim in the first month in which Fees are charged under the Agreement, or (ii) the total amount paid by Customer to MIDLDEV OÜ for the Services that are the subject of the claim in the 12 months immediately preceding the event(s) that first gave rise to the claim.
    
    12.2. Neither party (nor any of its Representatives) is liable to the other party for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential loss or damages of any kind. Neither party is liable for any loss that could have been avoided by the damaged party’s use of reasonable diligence, even if the party responsible for the damages has been advised or should be aware of the possibility of such damages.
    In no event shall either party be liable to the other for any punitive damages; or for any loss of profits, data, revenue, business opportunities, customers, contracts, goodwill, or reputation.

Customer’s obligations under this section include claims arising out of the acts or omissions of Customer’s employees, agents, end users, any other person to whom Customer has given access to the Customer Configuration, and any person who gains access to the Customer Configuration as a result of Customer’s failure to use reasonable security precautions, even if the acts or omissions of such persons were not authorized by Customer.

    13.2. If MIDLDEV OÜ receives notice of a claim that is covered by this section 13, MIDLDEV OÜ shall give Customer prompt written notice thereof. MIDLDEV OÜ shall be allowed to conduct the defense of the matter, including choosing legal counsel to defend the claim, provided that the choice is reasonable and is communicated to the Customer. Customer shall comply with MIDLDEV OÜ’s reasonable requests for assistance and cooperation in the defense of the claim.

17. <p id ="MSA17" class="xtarget">FORCE MAJEURE.<a class="up" href="#MSA0"> <i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a></p> Neither party shall be liable or be in breach of the Agreement (excluding in relation to the Customer’s payment obligations) if the failure to perform the obligation is due to an event beyond its control, including significant failure of a part of the power grid, failure of the Internet, natural disaster or weather event, fire, acts or orders of government, war, riot, insurrection, epidemic, strikes or labor action, or terrorism.

18. <p id ="MSA18" class="xtarget">GOVERNING LAW.<a class="up" href="#MSA0"> <i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a></p>
    18.1. The Agreement shall be governed by the applicable governing law of the country of Estonia, exclusive of any choice of law principle that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction; each party unconditionally and irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the applicable jurisdiction.

    18.2. Notwithstanding any exclusive jurisdiction provision above, Customer agrees that MIDLDEV OÜ may seek to enforce any judgment anywhere in the world where Customer may have assets. No claim may be brought as a class or collective action, nor may Customer assert such a claim as a member of a class or collective action that is brought by another claimant. Each party agrees that it shall not bring a claim under the Agreement more than two years after the time that the claim accrued. The Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

    18.3. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding relating to the Agreement shall be entitled to recover reasonable legal fees and costs, including attorney’s fees.

19. <p id ="MSA19" class="xtarget">MISCELLANEOUS.<a class="up" href="#MSA0"> <i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a></p>
    19.1. Some terms are incorporated into the Agreement by reference to pages on the MIDLDEV OÜ website and MIDLDEV OÜ may revise those terms from time to time (including the MSA). Such revisions shall only be effective and supersede and form part of the Agreement as of the time: (i) Customer enters into a new Service or Purchase Order referencing the revised terms, or (ii) a Service Order automatically renews pursuant to the Agreement or the parties enter into an agreement for a Renewal Term in which case Customer acknowledges that Customer has reviewed and accepted the then-current version of the terms as of the date of the renewal. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Agreement, the documents shall govern in the following order: the Service or Purchase Order, the Product Terms, and the MSA. The headings or captions in the Agreement are for convenience only. If over time Customer enters into multiple agreements for a given Customer Configuration (for example to add additional components or services) then the most recent terms referenced in the Service Order(s) shall govern the entirety of the Services for the given Customer Configuration.

    19.2. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement may be varied only by a written agreement signed by both parties that expressly refers to the Agreement. A Service Order may be amended to modify, add, or remove Services by a formal written agreement signed by both parties, or by an exchange of correspondence that includes the express consent of an authorized individual for both parties. The pre-printed terms of Customer’s purchase order or other business form or terms that Customer provides shall be void and of no effect.

    19.3. If any part of this Agreement is found unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement shall continue in effect, and the unenforceable part shall be reformed to the extent possible to make it enforceable and give business efficacy to the Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the pricing and other terms in the Agreement reflect and are based upon the intended allocation of risk between the parties and form an essential part of the Agreement. Each party may enforce its respective rights under the Agreement even if it has waived the right or failed to enforce the same or other rights in the past. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors and not business partners. Neither party is the agent for the other and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party. Other than Representatives for the purposes of sections 7, 10, and 11, or as otherwise specifically designated a “Third Party Beneficiary”, there are no third party beneficiaries to the Agreement. The use of the word “including” means “including without limitation”.

    19.4. The following provisions shall survive expiration or termination of this MSA: Intellectual Property, Confidential Information, Limitation on Damages, Indemnification, Notices, Governing Law, Miscellaneous, all terms of the Agreement requiring Customer to pay any Fees for Services provided prior to the time of expiration or termination or requiring Customer to pay an early termination Fee, and any other provisions that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.

    19.5. The Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous representation(s), agreement(s) or understanding(s), written or oral.
