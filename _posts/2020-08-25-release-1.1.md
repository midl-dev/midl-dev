We just released version v1.1 of the [Tezos Suite](tezos-suite). Deploy a cloud baker with an on-prem remote signer in a few easy steps!

What is new in this release:

* it comes with a **complete monitoring solution** with Prometheus and Alertmanager. You can customize it at will
* **cost reduction** by using smaller persistent volumes by default. You will receive an alert when their size needs to be extended
* support for several baking addresses
* remote signer now alerts you on more events affecting the signing operations, such as:
  * Ledger disconnected
  * power loss (runs on battery)
  * loss of primary Internet connection

Several people have given feedback on the previous release. Thank you!

We have released a first version of our [comprehensive documentation](https://tezos-docs.midl.dev) to assist you in spinning up your cluster and start baking Tezos.
