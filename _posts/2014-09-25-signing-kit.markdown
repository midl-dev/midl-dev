Here is how it works: we operate full nodes for you. We run and monitor them 24/7, upgrading them as needed. We pay attention to the network evolution so you do not have to.

You store your keys on a Ledger hardware wallet. We give you a signing device - a small computer with battery backup and a mobile network dongle for Internet connection redundancy.

You install a signing app on the Ledger, and connect it to the signing device.

That is it ! All you need to do is ensure that it has power and Internet access most of the times.

**This is secure**. We can not access your funds. All the signer does is cryptographically sign data, so you can fulfill your commitments to the network.
