---
If you are comfortable being your own bank and store your coins on a hardware wallet, we can help you be a validator, instead of nominating someone else. This way, you maximize your earnings. All we take is a flat fee (in fiat).

Here is how it works: we provide you a staking kit. You connect your wallet to it, and we manage everything else. We maintain full nodes 24/7 for you.

With this setup, you are in full control. We can not access your funds. All the signer does is cryptographically sign data, so you can fulfill your commitments to the network.
