title: We manage staking infrastructure

Here is how it works: we operate full nodes for you. We run and monitor them 24/7, upgrading them as needed. We pay attention to the network evolution so you do not have to.

We leverage many years of experience managing production infrastructure in major cloud platforms. Our nodes are deployed using industry best practices. We are paranoid about security.
