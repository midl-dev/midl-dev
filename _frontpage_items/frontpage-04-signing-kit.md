Here is how it works: we operate full nodes for you. We run and monitor them 24/7, upgrading them as needed. We pay attention to the network evolution so you do not have to.

There is however a crucial step that you must perform - cryptographically signing operations using the keys that you control.

Your keys are stored on a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. We give you a signing device - a small computer with battery backup and a mobile network dongle for Internet connection redundancy.

You install a signing app on the Ledger, and connect it to the signing device.

That's it ! All you need to do is ensure that the device has power and Internet access most of the time.

**This is secure**. The hardware wallet remains in your possession, so we can not access your funds.
