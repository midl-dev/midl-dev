# Tezos RPC as a Service

Our full nodes are operated on top of a cloud-based platform. This guarantees highly redundant and reliable infrastructure with 24/7 monitoring.

### Frequently asked questions

**How do I register for the service?**

Create an account on the [portal](https://apps.midl.dev) and create an RPC. You will be prompted for a payment method, then your RPC will be immediately provisioned.

**Does the service work with a web frontend?**

Yes, the service is accessible from around the globe and can be configured as back-end for a Tezos web application (DeFi, NFT etc).

**What kind of nodes are you running?**

We run nodes with the most recent version of Octez (Tezos OCaml node) in rolling storage mode. This is not an archive node service. Rolling storage is useful for web applications (DeFI, NFT) but can not be used for querying old blocks or indexing the chain.

**How is the RPC endpoint secured?**

There is no authentication method: the endpoint is accessible to everyone without restriction. The URL is unique and private to your account. It is recommended that you do not share it.

Additionally, we are working on adding restriction on CORS origin (so that the endpoint only works on your web app), and IP-based whitelisting for backend apps.

**How can I pay for the service?**

You can pay the service with credit card, Google Pay or Apple Pay.

**What are the payment terms?**

We are billing monthly, starting one month after your registration date.

**How can I check my consumption?**

The portal updates your current usage once a day.
