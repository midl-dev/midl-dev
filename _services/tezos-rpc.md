# Tezos RPC as a Service

Our full nodes are operated on top of a cloud-based platform. This guarantees highly redundant and reliable infrastructure with 24/7 monitoring. 

We take care of hosting, synchronizing and maintaining the nodes freeing space for our customers to innovate and focus on the high-level services on top of Tezos network.

We use:
* multi-cloud with DigitalOcean and OVH as cloud providers
* multi-region with Cloudflare DNS load-balancing

## Pricing

* first 100,000 RPC requests are **free**
* then, pay US$50 per additional 1,000,000 requests
* testnet RPC is provided **free of charge**
