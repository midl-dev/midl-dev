# Bake your Tezos with Midl.dev

Tezos bakers and exchanges take fees. Instead, we can help you be a baker and keep the rewards to yourself!

{% include _cryptocurrencies/tezos_table.md %}

[How did we calculate this ?](/tezos/figures/)

All we take is a monthly fee - in fiat currency - to manage your infrastructure.

## You hold the keys

We are a non-custodial staking-as-a-service offering.

We provide you with a signing device - a small computer. Connect your Ledger device to it, keep it online - we take care of the rest.

This is secure. The hardware wallet remains in your possession - we can not access your funds.

We eat our own dog food. We have one year of experience staking Tezos on our own baking service -  [Hodl.farm](hodl.farm). All our infrastructure is open-source.
