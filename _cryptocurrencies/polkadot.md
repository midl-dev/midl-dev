# Be a Polkadot validator with MIDL.dev

## Our technology

Polkadot validation requires constant attention and monitoring. We offer a non-custodial validator service with an excellent track record.

We operate Polkadot and Kusama validator nodes on Kubernetes. Our infrastructure is [open-source](https://github.com/midl-dev/polkadot-k8s).

We provide 24/7 monitoring, geographically distributed and highly available infrastructure. [Contact us](mailto:hello@midl.dev).
