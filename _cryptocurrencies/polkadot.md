# Be a Polkadot validator with Midl.dev

## Our technology

Polkadot validation requires constant attention and monitoring to prevent your balance from being slashed.

We operate Polkadot and Kusama validator nodes on Kubernetes. Our infrastructure is [open-source](https://github.com/midl-dev/polkadot-k8s).

We can help you implement your Polkadot infrastructure project. We provide 24/7 monitoring, geographically distributed and highly available infrastructure. [Contact us](mailto:hello@midl.dev).
