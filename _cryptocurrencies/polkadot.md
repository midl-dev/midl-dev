# Be a Polkadot validator with Midl.dev

## Our technology

Polkadot validation requires constant attention and monitoring to prevent your balance from being slashed.

We operate Polkadot and Kusama validator nodes on Kubernetes. Our infrastructure is [open-source](https://github.com/midl-dev/polkadot-k8s).

Our validation infrastructure is available as-a-service. Hire us to become a Polkadot or Kusama validator and earn fees. Our geograpihcally distributed infrastructure and 24/7 monitoring ensure that your setup will never be marked as offline and be at risk of slashing.

### How it works

Your funds are in cold storage in a wallet owned by you. You give us a session key to generate blocks and sign consensus messages on your behalf.

We are closely monitoring the developments in [remote signing](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/4689) that will allow for a hybrid model with on-prem signers and cloud nodes.
