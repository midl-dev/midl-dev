# Stake your Ethereum 2.0 tokens with Midl.dev

With the Beacon Chain slated to turn on on December 1st, 2020, we can accompany you to your journey to proof-of-stake Ethereum.

## Non-custodial validation solution

We offer non-custodial validation for Ethereum 2.0 : we run and monitor the nodes. All you need to do is sign validation messages periodically using a remote signer in your control.

We assist you in setting up the remote signer infrastructure based on [Prysm software](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/wallet/remote), then you can relax as we take care of all the rest!

## How staking works

To be part of the Ethereum 2.0 network, you need to put at least 32 ETH at stake. They will be locked for an extended period of time, until the network is fully operational. [See roadmap](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/).

You may purchase rights to run two or more validators. We support any number of validators.

**This is a long-term commitment**. Shall the launch succeed, your Ethereum 1.0 tokens will be irretrievably lost. Ethereum 2.0 is not expected to support smart contract and transfers for a long period of time. However, you may interrupt our services at any time.

### Raspberry Pi remote signer

We offer optionally a fully configured Raspberry Pi with battery backup and LTE dongle to act as remote signer. We perform software upgrades, monitoring and maintenance of the setup.

### Hardware Security Module support

We are committed to supporting HSM signers as they become available. Ethereum 2.0 uses a special signature scheme, [BLS](https://medium.com/@alonmuroch_65570/bls-signatures-part-1-overview-47d9eebf1c75) which is not yet supported by most cryptocurrency HSMs. Stay tuned.
