Your keys are stored on your own Ledgerâ„¢ Nano S hardware wallet. We send you a signing kit - a small computer which communicates with our infrastructure.

Connect your Ledger to the signing device, keep it online. Simple.

**This is secure**. The hardware wallet remains in your possession, so we can not access your funds.
