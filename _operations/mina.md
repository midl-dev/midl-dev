# MIDL.dev is a Mina validator since Genesis.
<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/js/clipboard-polyfill.promise.js"></script>

At MIDL.dev we are excited to be part of the genesis program and support the ecosystem.

## Why Mina protocol?

Mina is a constant-size blockchain, ~22kb. It aims at becoming the lightest and the most accessible blockchain protocol powered by recursive zero knowledge proofs (aka zk-SNARKs). We believe it is tackling the right problems and is well-positioned to succeed.
