<h3>Onboard your validator for automated payouts</h3>
<p>Polkadot and Kusama nominator expect regular payouts. While anyone can trigger payout, it is expected that the validator will do it regularly. If they are not claimed for some time, payouts are destroyed.</p>
<p>Our service relieves you of the task of regularly logging in to the Polkadot/Kusama UI to trigger your outstanding payouts.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h4>Who is this service for?</h4>
<ul><li><b>Validators</b> who want to ensure that they pay their nominators on time</li>
<li><b>Validators</b> who deployed their own payout script but want a backup service to take over in case their infrastructure fails</li>
<li><b>Nominators</b> who want the peace of mind of knowing that they will get their rewards regardless of their validator's diligence</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>We (MIDL.dev) operate Polkadot validation infrastructure, which includes automated payouts. We make this available to anyone for a fee.</p>
<p><b>Just enter the stash address</b> of the validator, and never worry about missing a payout again.</p>
<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
<p>In Polkadot/Kusama, payouts are managed by on-chain code. All we do is trigger this code. The payout is then executed according to the chain rules based on how the Validator configured their fee and payout destination.</p>
<p>We have no control over the payouts apart from triggering them. Anyone can do it. We just offer a guarantee of payouts.</p>
<h4>What service level do you offer?</h4>
<p>Your payout will be delivered latest 3 days from the end of the cycle (but usually much faster). This or your money back!</p>
<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>

<ul><li><b>9.99 USD per month</b> for a Kusama validator</li>
