<h2>Automated Polkadots and Kusama payouts by MIDL.dev</h2>
<h3>Onboard your validator for automated payouts</h3>
<p>Polkadot and Kusama nominators expect regular payouts. While <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-simple-payouts" target="_blank">anyone can trigger payouts</a>, it is expected that the validator will do it regularly. If they are not claimed for some time, payouts are destroyed.</p>
<p>Our service relieves you of the task of regularly logging in to the Polkadot/Kusama UI to trigger your outstanding payouts.</p>
<p>We also provide a <a href="/polkadot-vote-bot">voting bot service</a> for your validator.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<h4>Who is this service for?</h4>
<ul><li><b>Validators</b> who want to ensure that they pay their nominators on time,</li>
<li><b>Validators</b> who deployed their own payout script but want a backup service to take over in case their infrastructure fails,</li>
<li><b>Nominators</b> who want the peace of mind of knowing that they will get their rewards regardless of their validator's diligence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>We (MIDL.dev) operate Polkadot validation infrastructure, which includes automated payouts. We make this available to anyone for a fee.</p>
<p><b>Just enter the stash address</b> of the validator, and never worry about missing a payout again.</p>
<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
<p>In Polkadot/Kusama, payouts are managed by on-chain logic. All we do is trigger the payout extrinsic. The payout is then executed according to the chain rules based on how the Validator configured their fee.</p>
<p>We have no control over the payouts apart from triggering them. Anyone can do it. We just offer a guarantee that any outstanding payout will be paid.</p>
<h4>What service level do you offer?</h4>
<p>Your payout will be delivered latest 3 days from the end of the cycle (but usually much faster). This or your money back!</p>
<h4>How do I unsubscribe from the payout service?</h4>
<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@midl.dev">hello@midl.dev</a>.</p>
